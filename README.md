# bar-hopping_online_platform
Online platform for bar-hopping (rally tascas).

# Details
It is a platform built from scratch using html, css, javascript and php. In this platform people can register their teams on a google form, and then their information is fetched from the google sheets associated and automatically presented on both index and equipas pages.

# index and equipas
After adding a team through the google form, their team is added to the ranking, on the index page, showing the team's name, place and points. On the equipas page their team is added to a list of teams where you can take a more detailed look at the team's information, such as team's name, points, members, which pubs (bars) they have been to already, the order of the pubs, etc.

# postos
